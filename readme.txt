Just the [Gravatar Hovercards](http://jetpack.me/support/gravatar-hovercards/) module from [Jetpack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/).

All credits go to [Jetpack developers](https://jetpack.com/about/). Just saved you the trouble of taking [Gravatar Hovercards](http://jetpack.me/support/gravatar-hovercards/) module out of Jetpack and making it into an independent plugin.
